# Email Text Analyzer 

This project is the result of a personal curiousity about the language used in political emails, and how that language may have changed or shifted emphasis over the course of the years leading up to a presidential election. I haven't written any linguistic analysis code before, but I did have a few classes in the field of linguistics. I'm hoping to build this into something truly interesting and possibly useful.
